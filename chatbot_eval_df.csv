I’m facing severe depression and anxiety and I just feel like I’m going through a lot. This really distracts me and I cant get my mind off the things that are bothering me.    How do I overcome this anxierty and depression?,depression,"First, be patient because anxiety and depression are rooted in a person's outlook on who they are and how they handle situations and relationships.Changing these deep major structures in your life takes time to try new ways and see what develops, then fine tune accordingly.Most commonly, anxiety and depression relate to one's self definition.Reflect on your own opinion of yourself and whether you'd like making any adjustments to this.   Then figure out what stops or inhibits you from doing this.Try new ways of thinking and interacting with other people.  The changed impression you make on others will influence your own view of who you are.In America people take Pharma pills to not feel badly.If you prefer to make natural, long-lasting change then reflect, read, try therapy if it feels right to you.Eventually you will be better off this way than to take drugs to hide how you truly feel.","Anxiety usually about some sort of anticipated loss or fear of not being good enough to accomplish some task or in relationship to someone with whom the person lives.The way to overcome is to understand that these fears are inside of you right now bc of the way you imagine the current or upcoming situation.It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the way the other person treats you. Plus, it is possible that your anxiety is a symptom of not feeling completely safe in your living environment."
"There are many people willing to lovingly provide me with a home. I have food, clothes, and a university education, but I never feel like I belong. Even when I have a good time with people who are supposed to be close, I feel like I'm just out with friends and I never go home.",depression,"From the little bit you wrote, my guess is you haven't figured out where and how to lay down your own set of roots.Usually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselves.Unless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a full-time job, would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work, would offer you a way to establish your identity?My suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes, dislikes, and interests.   To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify, have a common interest and with whom you'd like to socialize.The more you realize who you are, the easier time you'll have to find like-minded others and feel securely at home with them and yourself.Again, if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people, then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths.","As long as you have friends to love and appreciate you, then your feelings of not belonging are more likely to be rooted in a temporary situation or in a way of being which is not characteristic of who you are.In a broad way, examine your own philosophy of life and the reasons and principles which organize your thoughts and emotions in response to events and circumstances.Since you would not be among friends who love and appreciate you, then the next best option is to love and appreciate yourself.This is a broad idea that you can develop over time.What specific ways can you take care of, nurture and appreciate yourself?Since being among friends is in a loving relationship with these people, then are you able to offer patience to yourself and simply try to enjoy being with friends, even if you do this at the expense of feeling different from them.This is a temporary feeling. if for example you are clothing and feeding and sheltering yourself bc you had some difficult circumstances in childhood and the feeling of being taken care of by someone who was unloving, then this sort of goes a little further to nurture and appreciate you.You may wish to be more generous with yourself in terms of caring and appreciating yourself.Possibly you'll feel more belonging simply by realizing you have the power to love and appreciate yourself.This in itself may be the formula which opens the door to know you belong among those who take care of you."
I've become so jaded that I can't control my thoughts. I cannot focus on anything and been having anxiety attacks.,depression,"Maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow them!If you're in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life, then the best way through is to understand the tension you feel.It keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within you.Anxiety is a sign of stress and weariness.  Your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to know.Then, when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone.","Anxiety usually about some upcoming circumstance or situation, in which the person feels or fears to feel helpless or out of control.Are you able to prepare for the anxiety you anticipate feeling?It may help to bring with you a small comforting item, such as a favorite book or something familiar ""feels"" like home. 

This may calm you enough so you can breath deeply and find the words to tell the person about your anxiety."
"After he got home from the hospital he was angry, then for a time wonderful. Now he is depressed and hopeless again.",depression,"Since as husband and wife your lives are closely joined, how your husband feels greatly influences the way you feel.Give yourself some time to concentrate on how you've been affected by your husband's suicide attempt.   Even if you decide against immediately telling him how you're feeling, knowing this about yourself will guide how and the topics you bring up with him.Is your husband talking easily with you?Do you have some ideas as to what is creating his feeling of hopelessness?The ideal approach would be if the two of you are able to discuss what bothers him and what bothers you.Depending on how far away you each are from such a position, you may benefit from speaking with a licensed professional therapist who can guide you and or you and your husband on opening up for discussion what feels stressful enough to merit taking one's own life.","Your question reads as though you are the one who must carry along and sustain your boyfriend's anger.More realistically. he is the one who must either decide to continue a relationship or not. The decision he makes will be based on whether he feels there is enough benefit to him to overlook the fact that you are carrying along his anger.He may not be willing to overlook what to you feels like a heavy load. And, if he does and you feel that the two of you are back on track with your relationship, then be prepared for a more heavy load of anger within you. It may feel unbearable to you, in which case, the relationship problems you each have, are the ones carrying you down, or, the plain heaviness of the situation is too much for either of you to tolerate.This kind of dynamic which you describe, of one person carrying along the heavy anger of yourself and your boyfriend, is unstable and certainly unhappy, is not the way to go to resolve problems. It typically ends with some type of explosion of the very unhappiness which someone was feeling but went ignored by the partner."
"I have terrible anxiety and depression. I've tried various therapists and pills, but nothing's helped.",depression,"Is it possible you simply didn't mix well with the particular therapists with whom you've worked?   If this is possible, interview a therapist before  starting therapy.   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your life.Also, therapy isn't for everyone.Read about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling better.What matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods, what you believe will be effective.","Probably what you need is a new approach to finding what is already in you.Last answer is good for avoiding getting worse with your depression and anxiety. Consider some of the new age advice which tells people they are good enough, or have a purpose to their life.If you can start to believe that your life has purpose and you are the one who can find this, this may open some of the tension you feel to not have a life you consider worthwhile."
"I've had posttraumatic stress disorder for years without my parents ever finding out. I want to overcome it, but it’s so vivid, it’s like it’s happening again. I'm scared and paranoid. I have depression, which I have been struggling with since a young age.",depression,"What is the reason you wouldn't want your parents to know you are trying to find your way through PTSD?Would they believe that you've been traumatized?And, do you feel that your parents had a hand in creating your trauma?There is no need to tell your parents you have PTSD unless you feel that doing so will help you.   Maybe you intuitively realize that they don't want to understand or know about this.How did you come to the conclusion that you have PTSD?If you are working with a therapist, and a minor, then  the laws of your State dictate what information your parents can ask your therapist about you.If you are a grown person and working with a therapist,  you have complete legally protected privacy of what you talk about with your therapist.In any case, a good starting point is to know exactly your own reason for wishing to keep your psychological situation hidden from your parents.","Your sense of self, who you truly are, is kept hidden and protected from what goes on in the large society.Excellent that you realized your sense of self was missing the confidence and effectiveness of handling life's basic everyday matters.Since you at this time are in the midst of ""overcoming"" your depression, the sideway path depression created, of not being able to know who you are, is a ideal in sense many people don't know who they truly are."
"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?",depression,"The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You don't have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people what's wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the self-doubt and hurt feelings.  No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry.  This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage.","How would you define ""truly happy"".""Happiness"" is a complex feeling that comes from feeling that one's life is going in the ""right"" direction and that are with this the best partner to make your life happy which, at least in some aspects, is with someone who has the same directional thought as us.The ""someone"" in your life will always be happier with you, even in moments of shared or mutual happiness, if this person talks with you about the problem that is creating an unhappiness at this very moment.The key is knowing what unhappiness you feel and with whom you partner, based on the four directions of happiness you listed above.You may not need a partner for unhappiness. In fact, without a partner, you may be able to concentrate more on the type of ""someone"" that you would like to partner with, the direction of the current relationship, how unhappy you are, seems unrelated to any problem in the current relationship.What do you know about your own split personality, other than that you've been told a split personality' is what you've got?Among many possibilities, one is not that you need a partner to be happy.It is possible that your need to concentrate on a current partner situation is being triggered by deep hurt within you from someone who has previously rejected you.What do you believe the split personality is helping you to understand and accept about yourself?"
I get very nervous and anxious/scared before sex.,anxiety,"Tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring, as well as listen to your specific worries and fears.Initiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time you’re about to have sex.This way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion,  not a prelude to sex.If you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner, then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined.","Since sex is a combination of physical and emotional intensity, I wonder if you find yourself feeling more secure in a relationship than you would have predicted, if prior to the relationship, you were more hesitant to engage in sex.The simplest explanation is that you are a person who values feeling secure, and does not yet feel this in the current relationship.It is also possible that you grew up in a family in which love and affection were either not shown, or not felt very much by the people who raised you.Since as a young child you had no choice regarding the way you were brought up, now as an adult you're able to understand the difference between your family and the way a couple can create their own unique way in which to show love and integrate this with sex."
I've been like this ever since I was in school; back then I transferred to another school. Now I'm thinking about changing my job.,anxiety,"Is there a certain problem you feel about living the way you describe?As long as you feel satisfied with how your life is unfolding then you’re making wise decisions.If you feel tension or that somehow doing as you describe is wrong, then the first step is to identify the way you feel your methodology described above has a role in working against your best interest.Basically, define what is problematic in order to address it.","What is your area of work?Are you unhappy because of a heavy workload or because of some type of injustice or unfair treatment?If you're unhappy because the feel of your work has changed, then it is possible to feel better by finding a different job.Also, if you are underpaid or not compensated for the amount of work you do, then maybe changing jobs will be a good move."
I know this fear doesn't make sense. How can I overcome it?,anxiety,"Stop caring about what you imagine people are thinking about you!Really this is the simple and complicated answer to feel better about your situation.Maybe someone is judging you, maybe someone isn't judging you.Until the person tells you directly what they don't like about you, there's nothing you can do.It is okay that the fear doesn't make sense, most fears don't make sense.","Here are a couple of ideas to get you started.Everyone feels fear at times. The difference is feeling fear of situations and people, feeling fear of Fear itself, or living in a state of fear most of the time.Fear is the normal response to being threatened, either by a person, animal, circumstance, some intensively threatening condition in nature.Fear by definition is a feeling of being out of control and at the mercy of a threatening other.Feeling ""at the mercy"" of fear, is in some ways ""good"", so that you realize how much strength and authority you usually have in your everyday life, and that you had simply forgotten about this, because the feeling is usually more below the surface than the level of awareness at which you'd usually operate.A similar, though not the same, idea can be applied to being threatened by someone.Feeling at ""the mercy"" of someone is not your usual state.Basically, develop a simple routine of soothing yourself. Make believe you have all the power in the world to do as you please, in a respectful and safe way."
"I am a really shy person. I'm currently in a graduate program which requires lots of presentations, but they always make me feel stressed out and less confident. How can I get more confident?",anxiety,"Have you tried rehearsing to yourself or a trusted friend what you will present to the class?   The more confident you feel in a safe space, the more chance there will be of making the same presentation to a larger group.Giving presentations is not necessarily a difficulty with communication.   It has more to do with performance than expressing yourself clearly.Practice, practice, and practice, until you see yourself improve in how you present.Also, keep in mind that whatever anxiety you may feel about making a mistake, the audience is almost alway much more forgiving than the person who feels anxious.Anxiety heightens fear, so whatever concerns you have, check if they are growing from anxiety instead of a realistic assessment of your abilities or audience receptivity.Good luck!","Take smaller steps for confidence in presenting yourself and your work. If you are always in environments in which you feel terrible, then examine whether this is because of your own self-criticism and self-doubt or because you actually are in terrible circumstances with difficult people and in way which feels frightening and probably starts the moment that you join the program.Very often, people who are sensitive, intelligent and creative, get placed in work situations in which they are expected to tolerate harshness from someone who has a position of authority, or is highly rewarded by the company for producing very good results.If you are in such a place, then the confidence to believe in your own work may be difficult to achieve.It is more likely you'll need to remove yourself from the program in order to grow stronger as a person.Sending lots of good wishes for strength and success in whatever area of your life which feels lacking!"
"I am a peaceful person, but I often find myself having thoughts about killing people. Eventhough I like the thoughts at the time, they make me cry. Why do I feel like this?",anxiety,"Maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware exists.Sometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others, imagine if they do the opposite of love, which is to kill, that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving way.This is my theory, it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamic.Most important is to keep an open mind to self-discovery on your feelings, including the ones which are uneasy, such as killing, to consider.","It is possible that at the current time there is tremendous stress in your life and the stress is triggering a very negative reaction from within you.Killing other people is not a normal way of thinking, at least from the vantage point of someone who doesn't start out thinking of killing other people.It is also possible that you have a significant loss in your life and your thoughts of killing others are your way of trying to process the meaning of your life in relation to the other person."
"I've been dealing with this for years. My mom thinks I'm overly emotional and refuses to offer any help, like therapy or seeing a doctor. She's seen me when I'm having a panic attack and just said I was faking for attention or that I'm a hypochondriac. I just want to get better.",anxiety,How old are you?Are you old enough in your State to have therapy without your mother's consent?Your mom's attitude toward you may be one significant reason on why you feels so much tension in the first place.Don't let her opinions and beliefs get in the way of what you know about yourself.Are you in school and does that school have a guidance counselor?Would you talk with that person about your difficult getting your mom to retain helping services for you?Keep looking for local resources which will support you either directly or indirectly by advocating for your right to receive mental health care.,"I'm sorry your mom doesn't offer you any help.The fact that she prefers to not offer help, doesn't mean you don't need any.The best way of having a conversation with your mom on the topic of your health, is to ask her if she would like to be involved in helping you.The person who is most likely to have a dialogue with your mom on the topic of your health, is your mom.If she doesn't want to talk about wanting to improve your health, then this is her choice. You can still make the effort to take care of yourself.If your mom doesn't want to talk about the subject, then be prepared to talk about your health without her. She may not be willing to participate and this doesn't mean you don't still require help, if is from a licensed professional in the field."
It's especially bad at night time. I am scared of sleeping alone.,anxiety,"Being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it, is the first step to addressing and handling it!Generally, anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life.  Somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very young.Usually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonable.Their inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young, hasn't faced the reality that the grown person is now capable, even if this takes some practice. Try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown person.Also, sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely.  This loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now, felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address.","If you are able to be aware of how you feel, this is a good sign of your overall mental and emotional health.It is possible you feel more of a risk to your emotional or psychic health in break up, than that you prefer sleeping next to someone.Examine and trust your own answers to find out more about your fears.Another, although less likely possibility, is to break up bc the other person is bad, mistreats you, doesn't care about you and generally behaves in ways that show lack of respect for you.If you feel mistreated then go thru the uneasy feelings of sleeping alone introduced by the person.In general terms, a break up means some type of change in two people's lives. There is an intuitive sense that sleeping alone increases the risk of finding out more about yourself. All the fears related to change are deep rooted usually, so the bed is only one current example of your fears from long ago.The way to dissolve these fears is by developing patience with the process of what you are able to accept, tolerate and live with."
"My toddler defies everything I say and doesn’t see me as authoritative, so she says no about everything. I'd like to hear some ways I can work on not needing to feel so much in control all the time.",anxiety,Trust that you are a good mother and that you love your child.Trust and love are their own authority and come from a different inner place than the urge to be obeyed.Trust and love are effective guidance and usually feel happier and lighter too!,"Probably a very good starting place for finding ways to develop your own inner security.To not accept that you do have fears, is itself a fearful place to be.At some level, everyone needs to feel they have good position within their social group or family and that this position is respected by others.There may be many, many areas of your own inner life which you already control. Maybe without realizing, maybe you're already in a place of security and simply need to more fully develop and realize this."
"Whenever I don't tell my friends or anyone what I did or stuff that's not really important, I feel terrible, like there’s a hole in my stomach. It only goes away when I hurt myself.",anxiety,"Sorry to hear of your situation.Possibly you are overlooking that your own Self is someone worth talking to as well.None of us are ever really alone because we are always with ourselves.Self-talk is a major part of what guides our decisions and how we make sense of relationships and situations.    Even after telling people the stories or activities, hearing their comments, it is always within ourselves that we decide if the way we were received by these others, the comments we heard back, feel right and accurate to our lives.I hope the feeling of a hole in your stomach would decrease by enjoying your Self.    I am guessing that hurting yourself makes the stomach hole feel less bad because the physical pain you create in yourself distracts you from feeling it.Enjoying your Self by talking kindly, loving, and having inner dialogue may very well decrease the feeling of a hole, altogether.Sending lots of good luck!","Go slow and take small steps to tell your friends that you did something which you feel is bad and not in line with your character.There isn't a guide, especially regarding the order or the number of times you bring up the topic with your friends.It is possible that your friends may not consider you to be a follower of their advice or a communicator of their standards."
"I have four children. One of them is in her 20s, and she cannot afford to go, nor can I pay for her. She went last year for two weeks by herself.",parenting,"Of what do you feel you'd be guilty?Family vacations are not a basic human right to existence.  They are fun, ideally.  You're not violating a basic human right.  You wrote that you don't have enough money to pay for her to come along.You may find yourself feeling more guilty toward yourself if you give more than you reasonably can afford to give.My suggestion is to tell your daughter your reason for not taking her along. Maybe this will open more dialogue between the two of you.","Your true path is the option which causes the fewest number of difficulties and the option to develop the most comfort and safety in all areas of your son's life.The answer depends somewhat on how strongly attached and what your son's own views and opinions are, to your daughter.First, look at your own views and opinions, then if any of these are in conflict with those of your son.His your son made any effort to go to your daughter last year when she was in your country? Do you think he would have done so, if it were possible? Is there any reason to believe the daughter didn't want to be found by your son?If you trust your own views and sense your son is simply following and adopting views you don't agree with and which are strongly in conflict with those you already do have, then it would be a good, safe tentative first step to talk with your son.When a serious matter is opened, it is often, discussed in a very much detail and depth all at once which is overwhelming, a lot of the time, for the person and doesn't lead to a resolution. At least by talking with your son on a simple level, you will establish a line of communication with him which may one day develop into more serious conversations with more depth to them.Also, just because your son doesn't want to follow the line of actions which you, as his mother would wish, doesn't mean he is against all of what you are doing or everything the mother is doing, regardless of mother and son being on the same or differing views.Again, just by opening the door to talk, you may be many steps away and not know if or when this will ever happen for the son who is in his 20s.This is not necessarily a matter of mother and son. If the mother/son door is opened and there is discussion that props up the mother's views, the son is still free to do as they wish.The very first step is to establish a relationship which allows for serious discussion.Move as slowly as your son needs and focus on your son's major interests which you think cause or contribute to the problems you are currently seeing and feeling."
My daughter is in later elementary school. She can't color in the lines. Her words jumble together when she writes unless there are big spaces or she skips lines.,parenting,"If your daughter is the same age as most of the other students in her class, and the other students easily complete the tasks you list here, then there is a problem in the performance of these tasks for your daughter.Without knowing more about the context of your daughter's life, for example, is she a new student to the school and class, are there major stressors in the home environment, does your daughter have friends, does your daughter have the same problems she has in school, when she is in other environments?Also, who is telling you she has these problems?  Are you the one who notices what you describe here or is your daughter or is her teacher telling you these facts?Depending on your answers to the questions, start to get clarity with the classroom teacher and the school guidance counselor as to the source of your daughter's problem.Good luck!",Maybe it's a jumbled mess of feelings that your daughter feels about herself and the way she colors.I'm glad you see the positive side of her having her feelings sorted out.In the longterm this is much better than seemingly jumbled feelings she has about herself and her creative expression.
"All my friends have either hooked up or had a girlfriend but me. I try to be happy for them, but I get really upset every time they hook up.",self-esteem,"If you mean “hooked up” as having sex with no care for the person, and you’d like a girlfriend, then realize relationships require more complex alignment with a partner than being a sex buddy.Pay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that you’ll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allure.Also, the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someone.Have patience and kindness toward yourself while you get to know the qualities which attract you to a potential girlfriend.","Does the actual fact of seeing your friends, their happy lives together, upset you? I don't mean to discount your feelings of seeing your friends with a girlfriend, but only to understand if you imagine yourself in a similar situation, in the happy relationship that your friends are in, does this upset you?The other side of the possibility, is that your friends in a committed relationship will mean less friends who are similarly available to you. Upside, is the happy couple of seeing their friends in a similar light as your own.Tell your friends your feelings so the they can be mindful of you in the context of having a new relationship.Hopefully your friends will be understanding and not judge you negatively for having an upset reaction to their news."
I am becoming a Water Safety Instructor but I didn't have enough for a proper swimsuit. I was told by a boy in class that my top was displaying everything. I was very embarrassed.,self-esteem,"Everybody does something or a few things in their life which looking back, the person wishes they hadn't.The key to feeling better is to realize that as long as you learn something for the future from your mistake, then you will be doing all that any human being is capable of doing.Your mistake sounds genuine, not that you were deliberately trying to create a stir or harm yourself or anyone.Now that this student in your class pointed out your mistake, you will learn to notice the appearance of your swimwear.Put in context that feeling foolish for doing something embarrassing means that overall, you generally do most activity in your life, in non-foolish ways.The incident would only bother someone who generally is responsible.  The mistake is a contrast with what is usual behavior for you.I hope you'll enjoy swimsuit shopping and find a beautiful bargain!","I poor for socializing because this sort of embarrassment goes very deep into my sense of who I am.As a fellow introvert, I respect your choice of not to socialize because the only one who knows what is best for you, is yourself.The boy who told you about your top was actually being rude bc he didn't respect your point of view.Since the question is, theoretically, for any person who is on the receiving side of someone's social-embarrassassment, ask the boy to tell you if there is a specific reason that you should change your top.It is also possible the boy doesn't know he was being rude and thinks this is the way to point out that you were showing more of yourself than maybe you wished to.In either case, if the boy has some empathy and is interested in talking with you, more chances he listens to you and doesn't get the message from you that you feel embarrassed, then maybe consider talking about these points with him.It may open the whole new world of having a supportive conversation partner for when you're not on the receiving side of someone's point of view, you'll have a chance to know what it feels like to have a good talk with someone."
"My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me.    He says he doesn't love me anymore, but I would do anything to get him back. Is there any hope?",relationship-dissolution,"Most important is to take care of your feelings regarding that he has left you.From your description  there doesn't seem to be much hope your husband would like to keep the marriage going.Has a long time passed since the two of you separated?   Sometimes, and really this is very rare, people decide to return to their marriage.If he impulsively decided to leave and now is a short while since he did this, then there is some hope he will decide to stay together.If he's been out of the house for a while and tells you what you wrote, then there is greater chance he's had time to think through to split and will follow through.As painful as it is to hear that someone with whom you'd like to be, doesn't want to be with you, accepting your hurt feelings will eventually let you come to peace with your feelings.To keep hoping against the facts of what he's said to you, only makes your own pain intensify.","Love isn't a bargaining chip so your approach to regain your bf, depends on what you imagine regaining him would require of each of you.In order to find out what your bf would require of you to regain his love, you would need to have a conversation asking him this very question.The two of you would either come closer together, or not, based on the results of the conversation."
"He was in love with someone years ago, and he still thinks about her time to time. He said, and I quote, ""That relationship is definitely over. I love you, but that girl will always be in my mind."" It just didn't feel like he appreciated all the things I've done to make him happy.",relationship-dissolution,"Trust your intuition on your conclusion about this guy.He may very well love you, only with the ex so prominent in his mind, it is possible your feeling of not being appreciated now, would multiply if ever the two of you needed to address a delicate topic.Since he is emotionally attached to the former gf, it is very likely he wouldn't be able to fully love you as much as you'd like and are already sensing.",Stay true to yourself which right now is probably feeling very unhappy in this relationship.
"My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?",relationship-dissolution,"In any relationship, including marriage, each partner will be better able to do their part, by understanding their own interests and wishes.Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage.  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to re-direct your speculations about, ""what does he want"", ""I wonder what he's thinking"", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!","It is very likely your husband wants a divorce.He may not be happy in the marriage and may not like you, similar to how you do not like him.Filing for divorce starts a new pathway of possibilities in your relationship to your husband.There are many steps before a divorce is granted. Having kids and not kids raises many social and personal topics. It is a much more complicated road than most people realize.Filing for divorce without having any discussion on the reasons of what happened, is a major step of completing the marriage. Once the divorce is filed, whether opened or not, you will start the new road of having all the topics, and your feelings about the situation, at least you will know these are your true feelings."
"As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.",trauma,"Sorry to hear of having witnessed violence within your family when you were very young.Your blocked memories are a self-protection from the enormous emotional pain and feeling de-stabilized by realizing that the people whom you expected to trust, are harmful.Already you are at the first step, which is to know that memories exist about the disturbing events concerning your brother.Probably the best way of finding your way back to those times, is by paying attention to all of who you are today.The more intently and with loving interest you are able to notice yourself, you will be gradually dissolving the layers of protective thoughts about intimacy being unsafe.Basically, you will be teaching yourself how to slowly trust yourself.Since trust is what was violated while you were young, you will be developing a new model for trusting yourself and others.Then, more of the memories of your painful and overwhelming times will make themselves available to you.They are simply waiting for you to be strong and trusting enough within yourself, to tolerate them!","Well, be sure you make contact with the prison to find out the information as to exactly where your brother is and what his condition is.To answer your question as to why most of us have no idea as to what prison a family member who has gone to jail, has done and is doing, I believe it is out of shame for having a family member who has done what is considered by the larger culture, to answer the question, ""who is this person, where is this person, what is the criminal charge against this person,?"" did you go to jail when the injury occurred?In other words, is your family doing what the larger culture tells them? Are they afraid to tell their friends and or social networks about what has happened with your brother?Also, many times when family members hurt each other, the fear is of being known by others, which disables the person to step forward and tell the truth about what has happened.Best of luck in understanding all the dynamics in your family system!"
"Sometime when small thing happen, like losing a comb, I get furious. I even start throwing things. Do I have a problem?",anger-management,"Anyone who asks whether or not they have a problem, usually feels at least partly, that they do have a problem.Your answer to the question is what matters.Since you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them, the reactions you're having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events, either in the near or distant past.Be aware, consider, reflect on  how you usually handle feeling angry.  Based on your description here, it is quite likely that the anger you show toward what you call ""little things"" reflect anger at much bigger matters that are uncomfortable and not easy to understand.Knowing more about the more significant matters causing frustration for you, may very likely decrease reacting angrily toward smaller matters.","Throwing things sounds as if you're having a problem with feeling and expressing anger. Feeling anger is a healthy emotion. Expressing anger by throwing things (as long as no people are harmed by the) is a way of handling the emotion, that some people can let go afterwards more easily than others.There is a difference between throwing things because you are angry and throwing things in order to quickly remove the painful feeling of being hurt by someone.Throw something, either symbolically as in how you imagine removing these painful feelings by doing this in a safe way, or if you'd actually like to remove the person from your life.Or, are you feeling angry most of the time, and that the anger is deep and difficult to express, whether or not you imagine doing something to remove the person from your life?If you ask whether or not you have a problem, then likely you don't have a problem, but rather, a challenge of understanding how to best live your life."
We're in an eight year relationship. My boyfriend drinks a lot. He experienced childhood trauma. I don't know how to deal with violent outbursts.,anger-management,"You shouldn't need to educate yourself on violent outbursts.  He is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts.   They are his behavior, not yours.  All you're trying to do is have a relationship with this guy.The one task to do is during a quiet time to tell your boyfriend the way you feel about his outbursts.His answer, whether he denies having a problem, blames you for his problem, tells you the problem isn't so bad, why are you complaining, tells you a lot about his willingness to change.Whether or not he considers himself to have a problem and wants to change himself, is very good for you to know.This tells you what to expect from him in future.   You can reflect and plan ahead for your own life depending on your tolerance and willingness to live with what he answers you.","I'm glad you're reaching out for advice on how best to live with your boyfriend's drinking problem.Since the relationship is a long term one, offer your opinion and advice to him. If he wants to change, be patient with how long this takes.Violent outbursts are frightening to watch and I can understand why you'd want to avoid them.If he is unwilling to change or doesn't believe that he can or must change, then ask yourself if you can accept having a relationship with someone who shows such frightening characteristics and behaviors."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?",intimacy,Because the acrobatics and excitement of sex has nothing to do with the meaning of deeper emotional attachment to another person with whom we are in a relationship.Try to distinguish between your feelings of excitement from the novel sexual arrangement and what you feel is necessary in order to feel emotionally close and attached to your husband.,"Maybe because the actual threesome is hollow and empty,Princeami.A lot of the way people handle situations keeps back their true self. If your true self doesn't wish to participate in the threesome, then having empty feelings is the only option to follow."
"My spouse visited the red light district a couple of years back in Amsterdam. After he got back from the trip he got me tested for stds. In the aftermath he has provided multiple versions of what happened, from having a total blackout to being touched by a prostitute. How do I know if he had sex?",intimacy,"The only two people who know the answer to your question are your husband and the prostitute.The question you did and can answer is the reason you would doubt your husband, which is bc of his multiple stories.Ideally your husband cares to restore your sense of confidence in the stories he tells you.If you state your doubts and your interest for the truth, ideally he will produce enough evidence of the truth so you will have facts and can make sense of them.   Hopefully the two of you will do this sense making together, especially if he did have sex w the prostititute.If he's unwilling to care about restoring your trust in him, then this is a different problem entirely.","The simple and most likely answer is that you know he had sex with a prostitute because he told you so.If you trust what he tells you, then you feel sex with him would feel relaxed and enjoyable.If you don't trust what he tells you, then find out who he does trust and ask this person to find out the answer for you."
"He told me he started to back away because I was asking for too much in the relationship. The more I tried to fix things, the worse it got. I want to make us better again, but I don't know how.",intimacy,Have you asked your boyfriend directly this question?It is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other.,"From what you write, you're a sensitive, caring partner who would like to receive as much love and giving of yourself, as you feel like giving of yourself to another person.Based on practicality and everyday life, is the balance possible between what you'd like to receive in love, offer and are able to give to another person?"
"My husband cheated while I was pregnant with our son with a so-called friend. This was before we were married. We split and eventually worked things out. I thought I trusted him so we got married. Now he flirts with girls in front of me. I've talked to him, but nothing helps.",intimacy,"This sounds very painful for you.Are you able to tell him how his flirting affects you?Maybe he doesn't care enough to change, and maybe he does.Long term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices, put up with it, which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship.   Or, of course, you can decide to end the relationship.  This choice is quite significant now that you have a child together.  Give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome.","Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship!Since you and your husband were planning a family, the pregnancy and then the baby, is its own stressor. Usually stressors are more easily manageable when the relationship partners feel secure in the other person.The areas which may help to decrease the stress in the relationship, are the two of you talking about is a great many topics, including these.If your husband is engaging in these alone, then there is a whole new area of stress and concern which the two of you would benefit by discussing.If your husband is agreeing to stop the flirting, then you may feel somewhat relieved by this decision.If he is continuing to flirt after you have spoken with him to stop, then the stressor is still there, just in a somewhat different form.Give yourself as much time as possible to sort through your feelings and what generated the feeling of being betrayed and taken for granted, by your husband.Try to avoid budgeting issues of your own in this phase of becoming a family, if possible.Expect these to show up at some point. They are just easier to see and deal with if you have some relationship disappointment to get through which by the way, are excellent pieces of learning material for couples.Relationships are our greatest path of learning how to love another person."
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.",intimacy,Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether he's lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.,"Hmm..it is possible to trust someone and also have doubts about whether this trust is well placed.Please give yourself a little credit and patience for tolerating how uneasy you feel, with good reason.The answer lays within you. Trusting someone is more complicated than trusting that the person will not harm you.Trusting a partner means being able to tolerate the fact that you are actually giving the person the power to take advantage of you.This does not mean you trust the partner.Trust is a feeling of safety. It is.I understand the need to know that all living creatures require time to observe and learn about us. And since trust is most often lost due to a circumstance in which the person who is this the partner, doesn't feel like being trustworthy, you may have plenty of time together on whether or not you feel more at ease with being together or prefer envisioning your partner or enjoying time alone."
"I’m trying to make marriage work after a split. Before our split, he lied a lot and broke every promise to me. I don't think he cheated. Last month, I asked what women work with him, so he told me. Yesterday, I found out about a girl that he said he forgot about. Should I be upset?",intimacy,"Are you upset, is the more pertinent question.Everyone has their own tolerance for lies and their unique reasons for being married.  Trust your own answers to the question you ask here.Also, think over the value of your marriage in your life and whether you are able to live with the unstable sense of trust that you have in your husband.Remember too, that if you are the only partner who is trying to make the marriage work, then your job is much harder than if your husband actively participated in making the marriage happier for the couple.","In your place I'd be more likely to accept your boyfriend's forgotten promise to you to tell you about the girl, than to accept his lie that this wasn't a big deal.In your place I'd be upset to have been misled.If the problem is that you accepted your boyfriend's behaviour because you believed what he told you, then the best choice now is to have a serious conversation with him about the effect his actions have on you.This type of discussion may motivate him to be a more reliable partner. If he genuinely apologizes and makes serious effort to keep your trust, then I'd be more likely to trust him and also to forgive the lapses of his prior behavior."
"I have been married for 20 years. He and I both cheated. I hid my cheating for 14 years. Over that time, I let life stress me out. I became depressed. When I finally woke up, he felt I had pushed him out.",intimacy,"Do you both want to fix the marriage?The relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too, will have one person who does all the changing.This dynamic itself creates problems of its own.About your husband telling you he feels pushed out, did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like this?All you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didn't like.If he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do, anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you, is ok.Because affairs create mistrust between two people, the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each other's trust.Talking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other, how you each are feeling, what matters to you, is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriage's future.","Cheating on your husband for  years and keeping the matter hidden within you, sounds like it has pushed you out of relationships.Did you actually ask your husband his opinion on the ways or what he would like with you?Whatever his answer, you now have the opportunity to know as to what extent, if any, cheating made by you, has affected him.It is possible that you two can now discuss ways of restoring the emotional connection between the two of you.Depending on when and if you talk with him and what are your respective interest, in a relationship with him, the two of you may decide for a  new beginning between the two of you.It is also possible he has his own emotional pain from feeling shut out from you and that he doesn't know how to address the topic itself.Who cheats and to what extent, doesn't really matter. Having an affair breaks the trust and the emotional connection between partners.Restoring these is on the list of possible ways of you two making a commitment to each other.There is no right way of introducing a topic, only the wrong ways such discussing it with him will do damage to the emotional connection between the two of you.Since there is no formula about the best way to do this, and whatever he says, listening to ones own intuition and taking from this, the real, self-honest work of restoring trust,Depends on guessing what he wants and what he believes are his rightful ways that you've violated them."
"My new daughter-in-law just informed me that she is smoking marijuana while pregnant because of her morning sickness. I’m in shock and I don’t know how to respond. I just lost my mom, and she was good with advice.",substance-abuse,"Have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these, regarding the topic?   When you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions, then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinions.Plan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in law.Since your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child, he may also be interested in being part of this conversation.Also, during your discussion, find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in law.It is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels better.Maybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky way.Sending Good luck!","I'm very sorry for the loss of your mom.Have you told your partner that you are pregnant? Please do this since your partner may have very similar feelings to yours and may be able to offer you the comfort and kindness that you need right now.Your mom's advice was, I'm sure, given with love and care. She was good with advice, you and her, then I hope your partner will learn to give you the same type of sensitive and caring attention that you mom gave to you."
"I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesn't wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.",family-conflict,"The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to you.It is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters.Each person, including you, has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone.Stick up for your own right to make decisions.If she doesn't accept your independent viewpoints, then this doesn't give away your right to have these views.Since she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you, then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about what's on your mind.If she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her, then feel free to make this choice.","You may start the conversation with your mom by telling her you want to discuss something about the way she is handling her anger.Tell her this in an indirect way, like you don't like the way she's handling her anger.Find out from her directly, if she is willing to understand and learn from you, how to differently handle the situations which are now creating such anger in her.Safe and happy conversations only happen when both people feel respected by the other person. This does not seem to be the current dynamic between you and her.Try scheduling a discussion instead of  weeknight and weekend afternoon in which you'd like to discuss something she's handling.The more formal setting of, let's say a scheduled telephone conference, might also help her feel she has a little more control over her life, and it will help you both stay on topic instead of starting in this informal setting, with you already feeling angry to hear her anger."
"I'm a teenager, and I know the importance of my upcoming schooling. However, no matter how much I put in my best effort, my family thinks I have done zero effort in total. What can I do?",family-conflict,"Your family's opinion is quite demoralizing.Unless you are lying to yourself or to them, then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family.The family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort.Maybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives.  It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselves.Possibly too, the family people may have a twisted logic to their words, as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do more.If you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you, then definitely tell them.If not, then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others, and how disappointing this feels.","First decide whether or not you feel family members believe you require effort to fully engage in your life.It is possible they hesitate to tell you their opinions for fear of upsetting you. And, it is also possible they feel you already are making an fullest effort, they just don't see their own hesitations and fears.Plus, I don't know if you've talked with the family or they with you to ask about your opinion. Not speaking to one another to understand the type of obstacles and difficulties each of you may feel in all areas of giving and receiving from the family system, doesn't help any of you.Also, you could directly ask the family for their reasons to not believe your reports on what type of effort you feel you are making. This way they're aware of your preparation, even if they don't agree with all the points you bring up here."
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?",family-conflict,What is going on in your life that brings up more sensitivity to the affair?The best way of handling your hurt is by noticing your own feelings and the current circumstances that increase your sense of pain.Concentrate on your own life and making your life the best it can be.,"You handle your anger in whatever way you can, which may include deciding to tell her certain points about your own life and the way it feels to you.

"Any time my family and friends are in an altercation, I’m the one who steps in. I’m the one they call to fight for them. I do this even though I have a tough time trusting the people I’m fighting for. I’m only in my early 20s.",family-conflict,"Breaking the patterns of relating to family members, is difficult work.In the situation you describe, both you and the family members who ask for your intervention, will be affected by any change you decide to make in the way all of you handle family disagreements.Always, it is best for any two people who have a disagreement, to talk directly with each other.   A third person distracts from the content and reasons for disagreeing.Maybe knowing that by pulling yourself away from mediating family arguments, you will in the long term be doing good for your family, helps you do the actual work of separating yourself from their arguments.Definitely, the fact that you're writing about the problem, shows you feel like doing something which feels better than how you feel currently.It is very healthy for you to listen to your gut intuition telling you to pull out of the mediator role you are in currently.You may feel guilty, your family members will most likely do everything possible to persuade, convince,  and push you back into their arguments.This doesn't make them right in what they're doing, it only makes your job harder of trying to let them have their fights on their own.","Fighting for others!I'm glad you step in and stop the fight when you are able to. And, yes, it is often the case that the fighting couple then turns on the person who has tried to intervene.Fighting is different than having a discussion. Only one person in a couple is able to benefit from a intervention. And, this is only true if the person who intervenes is the one who is able to change.The benefit of intervening only to realize the fighting between the others is similarly only to realize each one is fighting for what they believe. A compromise is a new idea which has no place in the linear dynamic of a fight.The only way the fighting pair can get past any resentment toward the person who tries to intervene, is to then have a chance to understand how their fighting affects someone else.The only way this is possible is if the person who intervenes is able to have their efforts understood and appreciated.Having an early life lesson in recognizing how one is unfairly treated, prepares a person to be treated fairly. And, being treated unfairly, is a sure sign to know when one is being treated fairly, not fight when one feels this is not possible to avoid being treated unfairly."
"I'm in my mid-twenties now, and my boyfriend of seven years and I want to start a life. My mother is 100% codependent on me and is extremely manipulative. She suffers from type 1 diabetes, which she uses to guilt me if I ever leave her. The problem is that I will feel guilty.",family-conflict,"Focus more on your own life and less on the very heavy descriptors you wrote to describe your mom.All the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to change.Since the only person who can change how your mom handles her life, is your mom, and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself, devote more energy and time to living your own life fully, despite the emotions you feel regarding her.","Feeling guilty is usually the sign of some inner tension within your own mind.You and your mom may already be very connected to each other on an inner sense level which will be strengthened by your sense of obligation to your mom.There may be a sense of loyalty and obligation to her which she feels.Talking out these feelings within your own mind will allow you to relinquish any guilt you actually feel, have a conversation with your mom on an inner level, and strengthen any emotional bonding or sense of obligation between the two of you."
All we do is argue. We never agree on anything.,marriage,"For how long has the arguing been occurring and does it relate to a specific incident or circumstance in your relationship?Arguing due to temporary stress and feeling lost or uncertain, is different than the two of you rarely agree on what foods to buy at the grocery store.In both temporary or longer term arguing, ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriage.If your core principles are rejected, you’ve been arguing for an extended amount of time, and the value of the marriage doesn’t outweigh this, then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it.","Are you each sure that you do not agree on anything?It is possible that you and your partner have similar views on many points and that you are each assuming that the other disagrees with you on every single point.If you are authentically interested to learn your partner's point of view and are almost always at odds with it, then, before you actually reach the point of arguing, stop and tell your partner you want to learn more about their view.There's no guarantee the two of you will come to agree on anything at all.By stating your wish to learn more about the other person, you are also showing a basic respect for them and their views."
"I've been with a man for four years. For the last year, he has said he is done, but he still talks, texts, visits, and has not moved on with anyone else. His words do not match his actions. I love this man, but it's hurting so much.",relationships,"Have you brought up the topic as to the way you're feeling?The best way for someone to understand us or to understand someone, is to directly talk about  the specific problem.To start the discussion w your partner, understand your own reasons for continuing the relationship.Given his stated disinterest in the relationship, your mood is probably affected by this.Once you are clear on how the range of your feelings, especially any fears on being alone, suggesting you may be staying w this guy simply to avoid such fears, then you'll be ready w your self-knowledge, to start a conversation w your partner about your relationship.","I don't believe anything either of you says. Feeling one way and doing something that goes in the opposite direction, are very far from being in agreement with each other.A person who is done in a relationship is very unlikely to continue doing all the things you describe here.Are you sure he is done? Find out!The only way to know is to ask him.Leaving a relationship usually requires more than just words.The pain you feel is balanced by the freedom of not having the person in your life.Have you done anything to actually distract or take your own focus off of the breakup? It is fine to do things that keep you busy, just don't do them in a way that increase your sorrow, such as drinking too much or having sex with the first person who is willing.Instead, tell him you are still considering your actions, which include leaving the relationship. If he has any objections to your leaving, then express your willingness to discuss these more fully, so that you have the chance to know by his own words, whether he and you are truly done."
"I met this girl in high school. She had switched schools at the end of the year, and I have not seen her since. It's been a few years. We had a very good and friendly relationship, and we seemed to have a lot in common. I never gained the courage to ask her out.",relationships,"One way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way you'd handle a similar situation in the future.Since a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis, right now you've got no idea if you'd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years ago.The relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner.  That you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize.  This way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property.  To have lots of similar interests, is another quality you appreciate in a partner.The more you know about what you do and don't like in a partner, the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path.","Since you haven't seen this girl in person for a few years, then having a romantic relationship with her would be very unlikely.Stay in touch with the friendship circle in which you and this girl travel. One reason for not practicing asking her out is that she might misunderstand your reason. Some girls are very insecure and would be fearful to accept a sudden change in someone's feelings toward them."
"We weren't long distance until he joined the military. I love him and I know he loves, me but it's complicated. He said he's not going to find someone else, but I'm afraid. How do I keep our relationship going?",relationships,"You're wise to be aware of possible changes to your relationship once your bf is away from you for extended time periods.All you both can do is state your intentions and wishes, keep in contact as much as possible, and wait to see how your relationship unfolds.To a large degree, each of you is relying on faith that if the relationship is meant to last for a while, then it will.   The military may add stress.This doesn't necessarily mean the stress will dissolve the relationship.Sometimes all anyone is able to do, is try.","Afraid of what, exactly?Find out in what ways your boyfriend is already satisfying you.If the only way you're satisfied in your relationship is by having a general, overall view of your boyfriend and how you feel in it most of the time, then there's a good chance of you and your boyfriend keeping a happy relationship.In what ways would you and your boyfriend benefit from having a different, more positive, view of your boyfriend?This is the question you each must address if the philosophy you have of your boyfriend is a good one to keep."
"I have had a crush on this guy for years. I last talked to him a few years ago when we graduated from high school. We left off on a good note. Should I message him and see how he is doing, or is it too late?",relationships,"You'll only find out whether or not it is ""too late"", by following through with wanting to message him.Regardless of whether the response you receive is what you'd hoped to hear, including not hearing back from him, you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity you've had for some time.","If you'd like to get in touch w this guy then it is not too late.Messageing someone whom you like, to say hello, is always friendly.Message received when someone is not sure about the best way to contact the person, is not considered very friendly. True, it is better than nothing at all.How is it possible you don't know if you have a crush on this guy or not?If you don't clearly know for certain, then find out by asking yourself if you'd like the contact or not.Don't contact the guy until you're clear that you'd like to reach him.It is completely up to you to make the first move, since he may not even be thinking of you.What stops you from simply contacting this person?You're not in touch w him and don't even know if he is alive.If you've gone as far as to look up this guy on social media, and you discovered he has a very active and full life, then it is almost definite you won't be able to contact him today.Continue to think friendly thoughts toward him if you'd like to do so.When the time is right for you to contact this guy, you'll do so.All the best in reaching the guy you have in mind!"
"I found out my boyfriend takes anti-depression medicine. Lately he's been saying he has a lot on his mind, and he needs time to think about us. We've only been dating 3 weeks but I like him a lot.",relationships,"Your boyfriend may like you a lot as well.People have different styles of reflecting on their lives, one of which is to retreat the way you describe your boyfriend doing.One point you can consider is asking for a time frame of when he'd be ready to discuss his thoughts on your relationship.He's entitled to retreat, as much as you're entitled to talk.Cooperating with the other person's way of handling themselves is one aspect of relating.Since the anti-depressants are a concern for you, consider bringing up this topic when the two of you do talk.","The topics you bring up are very relevant to how someone feels about a relationship and are great to address.Usually people are so excited when a new relationship starts that they have a lot of discussion about the new relationship.What happens after 3 weeks?You like this person a lot, they like you and are in a relationship with you. As long as the two of you are l having conversations which stay on the surface of your feelings about each other, then you're ok.If after a3 weeks, you each haven't gotten any more in depth understanding of the other and are happy staying on the surface of liking each other, then your actions of staying together does give each of you more time to know if you are happy to be a couple."
"Often times I find myself thinking scary thoughts and sometimes I even scare myself into thinking that something bad is going to happen to me. Once it starts, the thought continues going through my head and I can't get it out. How can I stop these thoughts?",behavioral-change,"I'm sorry you're going through this problem of scary thoughts in your mind.None of us are able to directly stop thoughts from coming.What is possible is to question their value, accuracy, and believability.Maybe if you examine the thoughts which upset you, you'll be able to feel better by understanding that the thoughts are not very relevant to your actual life.Also, another choice of what to do with the upsetting thoughts, is to redirect them.  When a stressful or frightening thought shows up in your mind, give it a happy resolution.   Basically, turn the fright into something pleasant or at least bearable.I hope this helps you at least a little bit!","You can try the experiment of replacing these scary thoughts with more positive and uplifting thoughts.If after trying this experiment for a few days or a week and you are still keeping the scary thoughts, then probably the next place to look is your outer life and social world.Positive people and those that are in your social circle will influence you in positive ways.Particularly if you are able to have long conversations and express your feelings to them, then this will very likely replace the negativity in your mind with the good feelings created by talking with the positive people."
"I know I'm ruining my life with a lot of the decisions I make. I consistently tell myself I need to make some serious changes in my life, but I just can't seem to even though I really want to. Why can't I force myself to change?",behavioral-change,"In general the reason people aren't able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to change.What the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotions.If you haven't got someone like this in your life, which is common, then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they are.Be patient with yourself too.  Change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change.","Try to understand what is holding you back from making changes in your life in the direction in which you'd like to move.Since you realize that new answers and new ways of handling yourself are possible, start understanding that your own thoughts, feelings and actions are the only parts of your life you are able to control.One way to start is to state what you believe about yourself. For example, if you believe you are lazy and you realize you do more than what your action would be to not change, then state your belief which would prevent you from believing you are lazy.When you know you do more than what your belief is, then figure out who you are. And, what your strengths are.Start with small changes and small successes.Expect to see and feel something different when you try a new way of handling yourself.Then, add another small change.And, keep expecting and looking for your own, inside action which pushes you a little more towards believing you're not lazy.If, after trying a new action, find yourself tired, then rest!Then, get up and go again! You'll always be able to return to the original plan of needing a serious action, some time in the future.In which case, great, you'll have all the material you need to know for the present, to help you stay encouraged."
"These ""jokes"" are made about everything. They seem to have the need to say something ""funny"" about everything. It's not funny, just awkward.",social-relationships,"I agree, it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all.  And, if a person only jokes, then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer, this can also be quite tedious.Realize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression.  You could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave.","Sounds like the problem is more about your comfort level with the jokes that this person tells.If you would like to get used to people who make jokes, then this person has a very unreflected and not thought out attitude toward other people.If you'd like to withdraw yourself from listening to this persons jokes, then find out if there is a reason or a person to contact so that you may excuse yourself from hearing the jokes."
How does a person start the counseling process?,counseling-fundamentals,Phone or email a counselor whose profile you've read and which feels right for you.Ask to get a feel as to the way the person would handle your problem and work with you.In my practice I offer a phone consult which generally continues for twenty minutes.I feel it is only fair that a prospective patient has a feel for the service they are about to purchase before they can be expected to pay money for a service which may not be to their liking at all.,"Possibly yes, and definitely worth finding out."
"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?",counseling-fundamentals,"Please feel free to cry during therapy if you suddenly feel painful emotions arising when you describe some of your unsatisfying and unfulfilling relationships and situations.Crying when realizing the emotional hurt and unfairness between you and someone, clears you for new ways of handling interactions.As a therapist, I always have a box of tissues on the table next to the couch where people who utilize my therapy, sit.I hope you will soon discover that once your tears unlock your awareness of harmful relationships in your life, you will quickly see the freedom to establish new and happier patterns of relating.Have a good therapy!","How do you imagine crying in therapy would be embarrassing?Therapists are very familiar with people feeling like a fool, while in the midst of new awareness and seeing how this awareness is freeing, raise the unwelcome fact of crying, if this happens in discussing your new awareness with your therapist.Therapists have empathy and care about the situations in which their clients find themselves."
